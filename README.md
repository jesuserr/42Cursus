# 42Cursus
Projects developed during Common Core (Jan 10, 2023 - Jul 22, 2024)

## Description of projects


- [Libft](https://github.com/jesuserr/42cursus_libft) : This project involves creating a custom C library, libft, which includes a variety of essential functions commonly used in C programming. It covers re-implementations of standard libc functions and additional utility functions, providing a foundational toolset for future C projects. The library is intended to be expanded and used throughout various assignments, ensuring a deeper understanding and efficient utilization of fundamental C functions.

- [ft_printf](https://github.com/jesuserr/42cursus_ft_printf) : This project involves creating ft_printf, a custom implementation of the printf function in C, to handle a variety of format specifiers such as %c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, and %%. The primary goal is to understand and use variadic functions in C, enhancing foundational programming skills. The final product will be a library libftprintf.a, potentially integrated into future C projects.

- [get_next_line](https://github.com/jesuserr/42cursus_get_next_line) : This project involves creating a function `get_next_line` that reads and returns a line from a file descriptor, enhancing your understanding of static variables in C. The function should handle repeated calls to read lines one by one from a file or standard input. The implementation will avoid using global variables and ensure proper memory management.

- Born2beroot : This project introduces you to virtualization by creating a virtual machine using VirtualBox (or UTM). You will set up a server with a specified OS, configure services, enforce security policies, and develop a monitoring script. The project aims to enhance your understanding of system administration and virtualization technologies.

- [FdF](https://github.com/jesuserr/42cursus_fdf) : This project aims to create a basic computer graphics program using the MiniLibX library to represent 3D landscapes through wireframe models. It involves opening a window, creating images, handling keyboard and mouse events, and visualizing scenes from various viewpoints. The project serves as an introduction to graphics programming and 3D modeling, using C language and adhering to specific coding standards.

- [push_swap](https://github.com/jesuserr/42cursus_push_swap) : This project focuses on creating a program in C that sorts a set of integer values using two stacks and a limited set of instructions, aiming to minimize the number of actions performed. The goal is to understand and implement various sorting algorithms to achieve an optimized solution. The project emphasizes the importance of algorithm complexity and practical implementation skills essential for technical interviews and development tasksâ€‹.
